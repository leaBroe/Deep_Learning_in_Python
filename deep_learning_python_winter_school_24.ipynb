        "### Project Overview: EcoTrendAnalyzer\n",
        "\n",
        "**Abstract:**\n",
        "EcoTrendAnalyzer is an AI-powered application designed to track and analyze environmental sentiment across social media platforms. By combining OCR technology with advanced sentiment analysis, the app evaluates public opinion on various environmental issues, providing valuable insights into public awareness and sentiment trends over time. This application matters because it offers real-time analysis of public sentiment towards environmental issues, helping policymakers, researchers, and activists gauge the effectiveness of environmental campaigns and public awareness.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Multi-modal AI Application\n",
        "\n",
        "Your application will use a **multi-modal AI approach**, combining vision (OCR) and text (sentiment analysis) models. This fulfills the requirement for covering a non-tabular modality, as you'll be extracting text from images (a non-tabular data source) and then performing text analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Fulfilling the Criteria\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Piping 2 or More Off-the-Shelf AIs Together**: Your project will use an OCR model to extract text from images and a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (like `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`) to analyze the sentiment of the extracted text. This perfectly fits the criteria and showcases your ability to integrate multiple AI technologies to solve complex problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Gradio App\n",
        "\n",
        "You'll develop a **Gradio app** that allows users to upload images (such as screenshots of social media posts) and then displays the extracted text and its sentiment analysis. This interactive component not only makes your project user-friendly but also directly demonstrates the capabilities of your AI solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Model Card\n",
        "\n",
        "For your sentiment analysis model, your model card should include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Model Details**: Mention the model used (`distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`), its source (Hugging Face), and its primary function (sentiment analysis).\n",
        "- **Data**: Describe the type of data the model was trained on, emphasizing its use for sentiment analysis of English text.\n",
        "- **Performance**: Highlight the model's accuracy, strengths, and limitations, particularly in the context of analyzing environmental sentiment.\n",
        "- **Ethical Considerations**: Discuss any biases the model may have, its intended use cases, and any misuse potential.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Outlook\n",
        "\n",
        "Given an extra month, you might consider:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Expanding Data Sources**: Including more diverse sources of images and text, such as news articles or blogs, to enrich the analysis.\n",
        "- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning the sentiment analysis model on a dataset specifically related to environmental discourse to improve accuracy and relevance.\n",
        "- **Feature Expansion**: Adding functionality to track sentiment trends over time, enabling longitudinal studies on public sentiment toward environmental issues."
