        "**Abstract:**\n",
        "\n",
        "For the project of the course Deep Learning with Python we have created an app that conducts a sentiment analysis over written text. This is a process where text is analyzed to assess its tone, whether it is more positive, negative or neutral. To be inclusive the app can also analyze text from other languages than English, because we included a translation model in it. The final product is the Gradio interface in which you can upload an image containing digital text. From this you will receive the translated text and the sentiment and emotion that are inferred to be contained in it. An app like this can be useful to bring across emotion in the digital world better. Almost everyone has had trouble reading between the lines of a text when deducing the emotion behind it. Another application of such a model can be found in AI customer service where an app like this can be used by an AI to provide more appropriate responses to its customers. A further application could be in more effective social media monitoring to make the job of social media moderators easier. All in all, enough reason to develop software that can analyze emotions written in text.\n",

        "For your sentiment analysis model, your model card should include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Model Details**: This app incorporates three different models in order to perform sentiment analysis from text images. We first use the python-tesseract OCR tool from the `pytesseract` package to extract text from images. We then perform sentiment analysis and topic classification using `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`, which is available on Hugging Face. Because this model only works with english text, we also use the `m2m100_418M` model from Meta (also available on HuggingFace) to translate the input text when it is not in English.\n",
        "- **Data**: The distilbert SST2 model is based on the BERT transformer from Google, which was trained on large amounts of english text (from Wikipedia amongst others) in a self-supervised fashion. It was then fine-tuned on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank to enhance performance on sentiment analysis tasks.\n",
        "- **Performance**: The fine-tuned distilbert model achieves a good score of 91.3 on the GLUE benchmark, but as we will discuss later, might struggle with some specific subtasks/topics. The overall pipeline's performance also depends on the language of the input text. The Many-to-Many translation model used here doesn't perform as well when translating Wolof than when translating German, for example.\n",
        "- **Ethical Considerations**: Developers highlight the model producing biased predictions which affect underrepresented populations. As the SST 2 dataset was sourced from movie reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, many of the statements on which the fine-tuning is based on contain judgement on the way (American) movies in particular portray one topic or another. Our focus on analyzing sentiment around environmental issues makes it quite likely for geographical information to be of relevance, which may skew results significantly.\n",

        "### Outlook\n",
        "\n",
        "Given an extra month, you might consider:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Expanding Data Sources**: Including more diverse sources of images and text, such as news articles or blogs, to enrich the analysis.\n",
        "- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning the sentiment analysis model on a dataset specifically related to environmental discourse to improve accuracy and relevance.\n",
        "- **Feature Expansion**: Adding functionality to track sentiment trends over time, enabling longitudinal studies on public sentiment toward environmental issues."
